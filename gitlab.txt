Requirement: Create account on gitlab.com.

Install and configure gitlab runner
============================================

Step1: Install GitLab Runner: (ON CENTOS1 MACHINE WHERE ANSIBLE IS INSTALLED)

Open firefox -> search on google "install gitlab runner" -> open first link -> in repositories click on the link -> follow the instructions for installation.

Step 2: Create project and copy runner details (ON GITLAB.COM):

Go to gitlab.com -> create a project -> create blank project:
	name: first-project
	untick initialize readme
	create project

Go to settings -> CI/CD -> Runners:
	Copy URL and Registration TOKEN (We will use to register gitlab runner)

Step 3: Register Gitlab Runner: (ON CENTOS1 MACHINE)

Register Runner:
	#gitlab-runner register
	GitLab URL: <PASTE URL WHICH YOU HAVE COPIED EARLIER>
	Registration TOKEN: <PASTE TOKEN WHICH YOU HAVE COPIED EARLIER>
	Description: PRESS ENTER
	Enter Tags: devops
	Executor: shell

Step 4: Give permission to gitlab-runner user (ON CENTOS1 MACHINE):

#visudo
gitlab-runner ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Step 5: Verify: (GITLAB.COM)

Go to your project settings -> CI/CD -> Runners -> HERE WE WILL SEE OUR RUNNER


Demo - Build First Job
=====================================
Step 1: Create .gitlab-ci.yml file and send to gitlab.com (Go to your Windows system OR DC WINDOWS MACHINE):

#mkdir myproject
#cd myproject
#vim .gitlab-ci.yml
create file with data:
 tags: 
 - devops
 script:
 - sudo mkdir /gitlab/
 - sudo chmod 777 /gitlab/
 - sudo echo "HEY I AM RUNNING" >> /gitlab/file1.txt
 - sudo echo "HEY AUTOMATION ENGINEER" >> /gitlab/file2.txt

#git init
#git add .
#git commit -a -m "first commit"
#git remote add origin <YOUR GITLAB REPOSITORY URL>
#git push origin master

Step 2: Verify: GO TO GITLAB.COM AND CHECK YOUR REPOSITORY, WE WILL SEE PIPELINE STARTED CHECK PIPELINE.

Step 3: Verify File is Created Or Not (ON CENTOS1 MACHINE)

#ls /gitlab/
#cat /gitlab/file1.txt
#cat /gitlab/file2.txt

Now anytime we will change anything it will execute automatically.
